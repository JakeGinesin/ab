# Automata-Best (ab)
Warning: Experimental and Incomplete. This is the nicer implementation of formalized heuristics.  

The *best* automata library, designed particularly for reasoning about regular languages. Includes various refined model checking algorithms that are the result of many private iterations.

# Todo
- [ ] Intersection Emptiness Heuristics
- [ ] Product (Intersection, Union)
- [ ] Proper Benchmarking, much nicer examples
- [x] Buchi Complementation Scheme (as to make use of existing benchmarks)
- [ ] Program Repair Scheme

# Far Future
- [ ] Language Inclusion to Intersection Emptiness poly-time reduction
